# Pokemon
The Pokémon game, as the name suggests, is a basic Pokémon game that is input-based. This game allows the user to interact with other pokemons to battle and catch them. The user can use different items to help them to capture new pokemons. Each and every pokemon has different stats that make them unique during battles. The user will also be able to battle other trainers that are scattered around the map. This project demonstrates the basic Java concepts that I have learnt, like using different data types and creating/using methods. Also, I have worked hard to make the game look beautiful and engaging despite being all text-based. One thing that this project helped me understand was the use of methods in making the program efficient. Looking back at this project, it is clear I struggled with making my code efficient.

Concepts/Skills Applied:
- Data Types
- Methods/Functions
- One Dimensional Arrays
- Two Dimensional Arrays
