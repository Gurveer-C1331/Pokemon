# Pokemon
The Pokémon game as the same suggests is a basic Pokémon that is input-based. This game allows the user to interact with other pokemons to battle with them and eventually catch them. The user is able to use different items to help them to catch new pokemons. Each and every pokemon has different stats that make them unique during battles. The user will also be able to battle other trainers that are scattered around the map. 
This project helped me demonstrate the basic Java concepts that I learnt like using different data types and creating and using methods/functions to achieve different things. Also showing how hard I worked in making the game look beautiful and engaging despite being all text-based.
One thing that this project helped me understand was the use of methods in making the program itself more efficient and look clean. Looking back at this project it is clear how much I struggled in the efficiency of my code.

Concepts/Skills Applied:
- Data Types
- Methods/Functions
- One Dimensional Arrays
- Two Dimensional Arrays
